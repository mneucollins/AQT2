                    The history of the AIDS Quilt is deeply intertwined with  AIDS activism. The Quilt has always served both as a space of memorialization and as a tool to pressure government and pharma to create just policies.

                    When displayed in the Washington Mall, the Quilt literally laid down a body count at the feet of politicians, urging them to address a global crisis affecting all.
